# Search and Rescue Automation
This code was written for solving an autonomous search and rescue senario as a part of a course in autonomous systems. 
The mocap branch was adapted to be used with a motion capture system for positioning instead of the apriltags. 
Note that the motion capture nodes are not included in the package.
